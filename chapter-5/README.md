# Chapter 5 - Basis Expansions and Regularization

## Worked examples & proofs
* [Derivation 5.2](https://github.com/alanjeffares/elements-of-statistical-learning/blob/master/chapter-5/derivations/derivation_5.2.pdf) - Proving that the linear piecewise constant basis expansions in section 5.2 are equivalent. 

## Code implementations
* [Recreating Figure 5.1](https://github.com/alanjeffares/elements-of-statistical-learning/blob/master/chapter-5/code/figure_5.1.R) - Using R's 'lm' function to fit splines from basis functions on data similar to that in Figure 5.1. <br />

* [Recreating Figure 5.3](https://github.com/alanjeffares/elements-of-statistical-learning/blob/master/chapter-5/code/exercise_5.3.R) - Cubic splines pointwise variance can be erratic near the boundaries, however natural cubic splines can improve the situation. <br />
